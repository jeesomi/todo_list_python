# todo_list_python
Python To-Do List Manager (OOP & CSV)

A robust, object-oriented Python application designed to manage daily tasks efficiently. This project demonstrates core programming principles including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File I/O, and Data Persistence using CSV files.
✨ Key Features

    OOP Architecture: Built using Task and ToDoList classes for clean, maintainable code.

    Data Persistence: Automatically saves and loads tasks from a tasks.csv file, ensuring no data loss between sessions.

    Priority System: Assign levels (High, Medium, Low) to tasks for better organization.

    Interactive CLI: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for managing tasks.

    Dynamic String Representation: Uses Python's __str__ magic method for clean console output.

🛠️ Technical Implementation

    Language: Python 3.x

    Storage: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

    Concepts Used:

        Classes and Objects (Encapsulation)

        Magic Methods (__init__, __str__)

        Error Handling (Try-Except blocks for file operations)

        List Manipulation and Enumeration
